# Reflection

### Process

- The implementation process was smooth and easy because of the outline/structure I wrote in part 1 of the assignment.
- While much of the skeleton functions I wrote in part 1 of the assignment did not make it into the final product, the main ideas of them are the foundations of what actually got implemented.
- When it came to changing features I ensured that I would have enough time to implement them and that the changes would still follow the original idea of the game.
- Since I have never designed a game from scratch before a lot of the process was trial and error and using my knowledge and experience from games I have played in the past.

### Things I Learned

- I learned that initial ideas of things are not always reflected in the final product.
  - I changed numerous features while writing the functionality code of this part of the assignment.
- I was able to gain a better understanding of the built in Date object in javascript and how timing events work.
- Learned to appreciate the importance of good planning.
  - Having good plans helped a lot in defining the direction of the project and what I need to complete.

### Challenges and Complexity

- A challenge I faced was wanting to change a feature I had not originally planned for.
  - I originally wanted players to take turns running the maze, but I ultimately opted to have players race each other at the same time.
- I was able to manage the complexity of the game by breaking down problems into smaller problems and using previous knowledge to find solutions.

### Initial vs Final

- I would say that my initial design and final product closely resemble each other besides the fact that both players are able to race one another at the same time now. Other than that everything else is mostly the same, which made adding functionality to the design super easy.

### AI

- I chose not to use AI for this project because I have never designed a game before and I really wanted to challenge myself. Additionally, I think struggling and trying to solve problems for myself is a lot more beneficial for my learning.
